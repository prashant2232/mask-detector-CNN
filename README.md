##🛡️ Face Mask Detector - CNN Based

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based face mask detection system that can classify whether a person is **wearing a mask** or **not** in real time using a webcam or image input.

Built and trained entirely using **Google Colab**, this model leverages `TensorFlow/Keras` for model development and `OpenCV` for live detection.
